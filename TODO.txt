-Frame class gives

-Needs a solid or simple geometries (cone, cube, shpere etc.) that can be created, destroyed and drawn with a basic shader

	--> Mesh can be created, saved to vram and then destroyed and only rendered with transform


-Intervals, for scalar, vectors or quaternions etc. would be cool

-extending intervals into safe functions (if input is not in interval, error) would be useful for manual, non-physical control or physical controll....
