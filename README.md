# SimulacraEngine

A framework for making simple 3D games. Currently uses Direct3D 11 to render simple shapes and particle simulations.  Features a templatized math library; '.bmp', '.csv' and '.json' file I/O; and a plethora of graphics wrappers.  Hopes to one day be API agnostic with support for D3D12, OpenGL and/or Vulcan. 

B.N: Some parts of the framework utilize DirectXTK.
